# The Foschini Group

During my time at MakeBetter Consulting, I worked on several key mobile app projects for [The Foschini Group](https://tfglimited.co.za/), one of the largest clothing retailers in South Africa. My role involved leading the development and maintenance of the myTFGWorld, sportscene, and Foschini for Beauty apps between 2019 and 2021.

This included building the apps using React Native, as well as creating a GraphQL API gateway to handle authentication and aggregate external APIs and app-specific data. Additionally, I was responsible for the development of a shared component library. I wrote this with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and used [Bit](https://bit.dev/) to manage the components and share them across the apps.

One personal highlight was that in one intense, caffeine-fueled night, I built a basic "CMS" to render the Home Screen marketing content for the myTFGworld app. It allowed us to easily configure the layout and content of the app's home screen, including text, images, gifs, call-to-actions, and product lists. It was built using a combination of simple React Native components and Firestore to store the configuration. It provided enough flexibility to render virtually every layout the client needed. Although this was eventually replaced with a more user-friendly solution, it was exciting to see how much we were able to accomplish in just a few hours of coding, and how a simple solution was able to provide so much value for such a long period of time.
