# Checkers Spin2Win

During my time at Makebetter Consulting, I led the development effort on the Spin2Win gamification feature for the Checkers Rewards app. Spin2Win was a feature that allowed users to spin a wheel to win vouchers. Users would earn spins by swiping their loyalty cards at the till.

This project included building the backend for keeping track of user spins, selecting the outcome of the spin, and awarding the user with a voucher, as well as the animated spin wheel itself.

My personal highlight was building in the ability to configure prizes and probabilities on the fly. I built the spin wheel using the magic of trigonometry and circle geometry, allowing prizes to be added and removed, and the wheel to adjust accordingly.

Another highlight was the implementation of load testing capabilities for the backend. This allowed us to test the backend in a separate environment to see how it would scale to the tens of thousands of South Africans that used it daily, many of whom were playing concurrently.
