# Checkers Rewards

During my time at MakeBetter Consulting, I worked on the Checkers Rewards app. This was mostly mundane work: pulling products & specials from their apis to render filterable lists, configurable content pages, etc.

My personal highlight was building a "bubble picker" component for selecting communication preferences. The options were rendered as a grid of bubbles initially and when a user selected one, it would expand, move, and push its neighbors out of the way:

The movement of these bubbles was achieved by a function that minimized the amount of overlap between individual bubbles and their "anchors." While I'm sure there were more elegant solutions involving calculus and trigonometry, I achieved the movement of the bubbles by using a loop to check the 8 cardinal directions and moving the bubbles in the direction that reduced the amount of overlap the most. This process would then loop until the reduction was negligible or until reaching the maximum number of iterations.

export default ({ children }) => <WorkLayout {...meta}>{children}</WorkLayout>;
