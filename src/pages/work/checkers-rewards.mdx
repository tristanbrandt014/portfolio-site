# Checkers Rewards

During my time at Makebetter Consulting, I worked on the Checkers Rewards app. This was mostly mundane work, pulling products & specials from their apis, to render filterable lists, configurable content pages, etc.

My personal highlight was building a "bubble picker" component for selecting communication preferences. The options were rendered as a grid of bubbles initially and when a user selected one, it would expand, move, and push its neighbors out of the way:

The movement of these bubbles was achieved by a function that minimized the amount of overlap between individual bubbles and their "anchors." While I'm sure there were more elegant solutions involving calculus and trigonometry, I managed to achieve this effect with a loop that would check the 8 cardinal directions to see which reduced the amount of overlap by the most, then move it a small distance in that direction. This process would repeat until the reduction was negligible, or max iterations were reached.

export default ({ children }) => <WorkLayout {...meta}>{children}</WorkLayout>;
