# Zepz

As a Software Engineer specializing in React Native, I focus on UI development for the compliance team and building the app experience for capturing customer information and documents. I collaborate closely with our team lead to design comprehensive end-to-end specifications for compliance workflows.

Corporate speak aside, I write a ton of code, review a bunch of pull requests and publish my fair share of Jira documents. I help my team debug the obscure issues that arise from our *vastly* distributed Java-based micro-services architecture using only Grafana logs and a dream. 

Lately I've picked up more backend work, as well as some data and analytics tasks. Stuff like remediating data quality issues, creating reports and dashboards to help the team make data-driven decisions, and maintaining a service or two that were orphaned in our recent reorg.
